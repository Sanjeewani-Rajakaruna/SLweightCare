This document explains how to install the SLweightCare system and provides installation 
guides to the users step by step clearly. Since this is a web-based system, users have to 
access this through the internet after hosting the system in a specific URL.
But, for modification and correction purposes I have instructed offline access to the 
system. 
1. User should have a computer with a maximum of 1GB memory space.
2. Next, install any of the localhost software like Wamp or Xampp, to the computer.
3. Then, the user has to import the database of the system.
i. Go to the browser and type “localhost/phpMyAdmin” in the address bar.
ii. After, log into the phpMyAdmin, create an SQL database as “slweightcare” 
by clicking New on the left panel.

iii. Click on the Import tab in the top center panel.

iv. Under the File to Import section, click Browse and locate the file present 
in the Database folder inside the Developed files of the system folder.

v. From the Format section, select SQL.
vi. Click the Go button at the bottom.
(If you imported the database, all tables would show when selecting the 
database in the left side panel.)
4. Then, paste all the system developed files into the localhost. If the server is 
Xammp place those files into C://Xammp/htdocs and if the server is Wamp place 
those files in C://wamp/www.
5. Thereafter, the user should restart the localhost server by double click on the 
server icon. 
6. Now, view your browser and type localhost and the folder name which placed 
the system files
